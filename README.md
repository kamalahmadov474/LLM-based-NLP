Welcome to the LLM-based NLP Application! This repository contains code, models, and resources for building advanced Natural Language Processing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether you want to generate text, classify data, extract entities, or build custom NLP workflows, this repo has everything you need.

Contents
Models: Pretrained and fine-tuned LLM models for various NLP tasks.

Inference: Scripts to run text generation, classification, NER, and question answering.

Fine-tuning: Utilities and code to fine-tune models on your own datasets.

Datasets: Sample datasets for training and evaluation.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use and fine-tune the models.

Utilities: Helpful scripts for data preprocessing, evaluation, and deployment.
